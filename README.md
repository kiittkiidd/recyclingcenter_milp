## **Decentralized Recycling Center Network Design for End-of-Life Electric Vehicle Batteries in Indonesia**

### **Dataset Description**
This dataset is used for optimizing the recycling network of **end-of-life NMC batteries** in Indonesia. The primary objective is to determine suitable locations for establishing **Decentralized Recycling Centers (DRCs)**. DRCs are facilities that process used batteries into **black mass**, a key material in battery recycling.

### **Dataset Structure**
The dataset consists of **two main files**, each representing different **scenarios**:

- **S1 (Scenario 1):** The optimization process runs for the entire Indonesia **without regional restrictions**.
- **S2 (Scenario 2):** The optimization is conducted **per island**, and the results are merged back into a single dataset.

Each scenario contains **three supply versions**:

- **Version 1**
- **Version 2**
- **Version 3**

The dataset aims to analyze the **number of abandoned batteries**, identify areas requiring government intervention, and determine the optimal allocation of recycling centers.

### **Usage Context**
This dataset is utilized in an undergraduate thesis from the **Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM)**, titled:

> **"LARGE-SCALE MULTI-PERIOD LOCATION ALLOCATION PROBLEM UNTUK DESAIN JARINGAN DAUR ULANG DECENTRALIZED RECYCLING CENTER BATERAI BEKAS KENDARAAN LISTRIK DI INDONESIA."**
